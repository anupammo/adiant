                To talk about Midbrain Activation, we must focus on our great saint Swami Vivekananda who opened the path for the Americans to research upon the mystic  but well-known subject for ages – Midbrain Activation  Coming to the point about the concept, firstly it should be mentioned about today’s present problems of the parents. Other than studious students , most of the parents are facing various problems of their offspring’s such as unmindful ness, short of memory, restlessness, frustrations, and depressions. Today’s parents are con fused as  to how to bring up their children up to their expectations and dreams. Here comes the role of mid-brain activation which claims to solve all their problems and more. Let’s be more  clear about it. We have a single brain which can be divided into right and left hemisphere. According to the scientists, when the left hemisphere works strongly, we are more active on our right- side overall and vise versa, the working percentage of each hemisphere being 5% in average, while the other one is 0%. People having more IQ level may have more percentage what so ever. If we compare our brain with a memory chip , left hemisphere voraciously grasp any information put in it al along while right hemisphere is supposed to be the output of those memory ,but unexpectedly it doesn’t happen that way. Most of us can’t even remember what we had for breakfast day before yesterday let alone more previous days. Its because our input level from left brain is much more than the output level from right brain. So we can’t blame the children for not remembering their studies properly. The solution to this problems can be, making the output level same as input level. Here comes the role of midbrain and its activation. Midbrain is nothing but the pineal gland present in cerebellum , one of the vital part of the brain, in other word, it is the power house of the brain. The pineal gland secrets a hormone and thus the midbrain gets and remains activated. So, we can say, the hormonal secretion of pineal gland is known as midbrain activation. Midbrain’s activities are, to strengthen our five senses to the extreme, to increase IQ level, to decrease EQ level (depression), and last but not the least synchronizes left and right brain so that both can work simultaneously . Once the midbrain is activated, one’s memory level is boozed up, both the brains optimum potential is unleashed to the utmost infinitely. Mind reading is possible too. There is no side effect so far as midbrain activation is concerned because no external entities are put into it any how. Meditation, music therapy, eye exercise, physical exercise , special dances , brain gym , yoga etc are the enlisted process which are practiced here during three semesters --- Beginner , Inter ,and Advance each having four months duration . A special course for better studies and superb memory is also imparted to the children which is …. MNEMONICS after the completion of Midbrain activation course.</p>

                DMIT (Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence test)  is a super scientific technology by which one can know all about his/her future including, what should be his profession which can make him famous. It is said god has given each of us, one or few talents but being unaware of this fact parents try their utmost to make their offspring multitalented, the results being nil. But , if once, the parents come to know the real and definite future of their offspring, then they can absolutely escape from all their headaches and tensions , as to how to bring up their children .DMIT is an absolute guideline for them. Dr. Howard Gardner an American scientist had discovered this method related to skin ( dermis) . We are all aware that our finger prints are unchangeable and thus permanent and officially very important. Not a single print resemble the other whether  its a single person or many people . But science has proved that out of 64 thousands people, two persons can claim that their fingerprints resemble. But if 30 prints ( 3 prints from a single finger---left ,middle, right) , not a single person out of 700 crores of people can claim of resemblance . Now after scanning 30 finger prints of a single person ,after analyzing them, all the future documents can be stated , as mentioned before , the total report of which will be printed in a spiral book of 79 pages. To prove the truth of the stated facts , few examples can be mentioned importantly.
                The world famous Mr. Sourav Ganguly used to play both cricket and football in first division level in his boy hood. But after his DMIT was done , it  was predicted to him and later it was proved that he would be a world famous cricketer . 
                Same thing happened in case of our another world famous cricketer Mr. Sachin Tendulkar . 
                The mystery behind winning hundreds of gold medals by the American, Chinese ,Japanese, Korean players is nothing but this human friendly technology , the extraordinary superb technology DMIT . 
                Even in Scotland yard , the criminals are detected by this technology ,according to which different cases are dealt with. 
                It is a 100% Guaranteed technology , and out of three Indian analysts, Adiant’s respected secretary Mr. Biplab Kumar Mandal is one and Adiant is proud to announce that . Any person of any age group can undergo this test . It helps in matrimonial matchmaking too. In near future , we will be fortunate to receive DMIT medical along with Devi Shetty institution , where 18 kinds of diseases can be detected and they can be treated successfully with no medicine and pain . </p>
